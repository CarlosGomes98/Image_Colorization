# Image Colorization

My Third Year Project for the BSc in Computer Science where I investigate automatic image colorization. This is the process of taking a black and white image and automatically adding color to it.

### Contents

This repository contains several implementations of methods to preform colorization:

  #### 1. A deep CNN with a MSE loss

  #### 2. A deep CNN using categorical cross entropy loss (Based on http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/)
