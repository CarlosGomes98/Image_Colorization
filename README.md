# Image Colorization

My Third Year Project for the BSc in Computer Science where I investigate automatic image colorization. This is the process of taking a black and white image and automatically adding color to it.

### Contents

This repository contains several implementations of methods to preform colorization:

  1. A deep CNN with a MSE loss.
  2. A deep CNN using categorical cross entropy loss (Based on http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/)
  3. A GAN (hopefully soon)
  
### Examples to come soon
